          <p class="text-muted text-left">The starbucks reserve roastery is one of the biggest starbucks stores in the USA. It is filled with modern lights, technology, and amazing designs. This starbucks sells all sorts of food, even ones you may not find at your regular daily starbucks. For example, Tiramisu. I've seen the first 2 floors and they're so pretty. I took many photos and would recommend people visiting while in Chicago.</p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">Athena is a big, beautiful restaurant. I saw many greek mythology related statues and artwork around the store. Including nice lights and amazing food. Some orders were even made infront of you, with fire. Me and my friends enjoyed eating there and it would be a good place to come to if you like Greek Food.</p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">Brooklyn Boulders is a bouldering, rock climbing, and even gym area. Members can go and rent shoes and harnesses for bouldering & toproping. I saw many different difficulties for bouldering and attempted many as well. The members switch out the areas every week or so to switch difficulties and get people to experience something new. Definitely a nice spot for people into being active.</p>

          <p>Watched a few weeks ago with many class/schoolmates. It is a movie about the director of every halloween feeling trapped in this world of his. Feeling as if he wants more, and that the years he had directed halloween were getting boring for him. Eventually, he finds something new. It didn't go as planned though, leading to the points up till the end of the movie. A very nice show to watch in groups, would recommend.</p>

            <p>Watched when the movie came out. It is a movie about Dora, who had lived out in the wild for years, had finally been sent to a public high school. Eventually, she has to solve a mystery of a lost civilization to save her parents. This movie was amazing and definitely was stuck in my head for a few weeks afterward. Would recommend.</p>

              <p>Watched with some friends not too long ago. A very fun and dramatic movie. Young Gru looks up to a group of Villians, "Vicious 6", and his idol ends up getting kicked out. Seeking for revenge, he tries to join the Vicious 6 and they end up getting lots of tension between them, while they both fight for a sacred, dangerous item. It's a great movie for young children and definitely gave me a few giggles.</p>

                <p>A very nice and popular movie for kids. It is about a family who has had these gifts (sort of powers) passed down throughout the years. One generation, Mirabel (main character) doesn't get a gift and is treated unfairly. The end of the movie is shocking & sad and definitely can teach a nice lesson to kids. Would recommend. (also has catchy songs).</p>
